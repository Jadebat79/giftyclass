What is Cloud?
- The term Cloud refers to a Network or Internet. In other words, we can say that Cloud is something, which is
present at remote location. 
- Cloud can provide services over network, i.e., on public networks or on private
networks, i.e., WAN, LAN or VPN.
-Applications such as e-mail, web conferencing, customer relationship management (CRM),all run in cloud.

What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud Computing refers to manipulating, configuring, and accessing the applications online. It offers online
data storage, infrastructure and application.
- We need not to install a piece of software on our local PC and this is how the cloud computing
overcomes platform dependency issues. Hence, the Cloud Computing is making our business
application mobile and collaborative.

Basic Concepts
- There are certain services and models working behind the scene making the cloud computing feasible and 
accessible to end users. 
- Following are the working models for cloud computing
    - Deployment Models
    - Service Models

  DEPLOYMENT MODELS
  Deployment models define the type of access to the cloud, i.e., how the cloud is located? Cloud can have any of
  the four types of access
    - PUBLIC CLOUD
      The Public Cloud allows systems and services to be easily accessible to the general public. 
      Public cloud may be less secure because of its openness, e.g., e-mail.

    - PRIVATE CLOUD
      The Private Cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an organization. 
      It offers increased security because of its private nature.

    - COMMUNITY CLOUD
      The Community Cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by group of organizations.

    - HYBRID CLOUD
      The Hybrid Cloud is mixture of public and private cloud. However, the critical activities are performed using
      private cloud while the non-critical activities are performed using public cloud.
  
  SERVICE MODELS
  Service Models are the reference models on which the Cloud Computing is based. 
  These can be categorized into three basic service models as listed below
    1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    2.Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    3.Software as a Service (SaaS)

  There are many other service models all of which can take the form like XaaS, i.e., Anything as a Service. This
  can be Network as a Service, Business as a Service, Identity as a Service, Database as a
  Service or Strategy as a Service.
  
The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the most basic level of service. Each of the service models make use of
the underlying service model, i.e., each inherits the security and management mechanism from the underlying
model,

Linux 

commands 
 1. ls - list contents of directories
 2. cd - Change directories 
 3. mkdir - create directories 
 4. touch - create files (Add any extension of your choices .txt, .pdf, .mp3 .ppt)
 5. touch filename {1..20}.extension - to create multiple files 
      eg. touch jade {1..20}.pdf
          touch gift {1..20}.ppt
 6.mv - For renaming files 
      eg. mv jade.pdf gift.pdf
 7.cat - to view contents in files 
 8. cp - too copy files to a different destination 
 9. mv - moving to another directory 
 10. rm - to delete files       

Assignment 1 
  1.Create 2 new directories with names of your choice
  2.Create 20 files each of the following extensions
      i. .pdf 
      ii. .docx 
      iii. .ppt 
      iv. .xls 
  3. move the .pdf files to one of the directories
  4. move the .xls files to the other directory 
  5. copy the .docx files to the directory that contains .pdf files
